                "This analysis aims to examine the effectiveness of policy interventions meant to reduce the opioid abuse. Specifically, Florida, Texas, and Washington each implemented policies with this intent in the early 2000's (2010, 2007, and 2012 respectively). To understand the impact of these policies, this analysis will compare the amount of opioids prescribed and the amount of drug overdose deaths to their respective quanities, both before and after the policies took place in their respective jurisdictions.  Each jurisdiction will be compared to the quantities in the remainder of the nation where no policies are in place.  While the intent of regulations is meant to reduce opioid abuse, regulations increase the ability of addicts to access opioids legally, and may have unexpected effects."

Furthermore, it is expected that the average annual percent change in each per capita quantity is trending down over time after the policy is implemented.  Second, the average annual percent change in each of the per capita opioid quantities should be substantailly less in jurisdictions where the policy was implemented compared to jurisdictions where the policy was not implemented.

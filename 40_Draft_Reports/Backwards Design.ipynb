    "### This analysis aims to examine the effectiveness of policy interventions meant to reduce the opioid abuse. Specifically, Florida, Texas, and Washington each implemented policies with this intent in the early 2000's (2010, 2007, and 2012 respectively). To understand the impact of these policies, this analysis will compare the amount of opioids prescribed and the amount of drug overdose deaths to their respective quanities, both before and after the policies took place in their respective jurisdictions.  Each jurisdiction will be compared to the quantities in the remainder of the nation where no policies are in place.  While the intent of regulations is meant to reduce opioid abuse, regulations increase the ability of addicts to access opioids legally, and may have unexpected effects."

Similarly, the values selected from the US Underlying Cause of Death statistics will be the county, year, cause of death, and number of deaths.  This data will be filtred for cause of deaths that are considered opioid overdoses, and aggregated over the county and year to calculate the total number of opioid overdose deaths annually in each county.  Finally, the values selected from the US Census population estimate dataset will be county and population estimate for each year over the time period analyzed.
